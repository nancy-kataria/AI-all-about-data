### UFO Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of UFO sightings. The script reads data from a CSV file, cleans it, and generates visualizations to help understand the distribution and textual content of the sightings.

This is a part of code executed while learning "All about Data" in the ACMCSUF AI workshop.

## Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:
- **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset using Pandas.
- **Data Exploration:** Inspecting the first few rows, viewing column names, and summarizing key columns.
- **Data Cleaning:** Checking for and removing missing values.
- **Data Visualization:** 
  - Plotting the count of UFO sightings by country using Seaborn.
  - Creating a word cloud from the comments using the WordCloud library and Matplotlib.
